# evolution-algo-1
All things written here may be work in progress, as such, may not be **yet** included in the code.

Improved version of my old evolution-algo-0. <br>
Dubbed face-fronter, but able of manipulation of any vector of numbers (32-bit float). <br>
Unlike old algorithm, this one was designed with modularity in mind from start, as such, <br>
it divides every structure such that it doesn't influence any other module of this package. <br>
You can easly add support for files other than '.png' files, without affecting the ai algorithm itself.
Ai itself is saved as long string loaded into text file, more on that can be found in README file ragarding that topic.
<br>
Planned features:
  * **Targetted mutation**
  * **Multithreaded caculation**
  * **Support for raw data**
  * *"SuperNodes" support, allowing targetted calculations*

While features written in **bold** are pretty much guaranteed, ones written in *latin* may be discarted.<br>
